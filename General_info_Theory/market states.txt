You're referring to an intriguing concept attributed to Jim Simons (note: spelling), the founder of Renaissance Technologies. 
According to a source on Quant Scientist Newsletter,
he outlined eight distinct “market states” or regimes—not a widely publicized part of his work, but interesting nonetheless 

Here are those eight market regimes, with suggested trading strategies or approaches that typically align with each:

Jim Simons’ 8 Market States & Strategic Implications

Upward Trend, Increasing Volume, Low Volatility (Bull Market)

Regime: A calm, strong rally.

Strategy: Trend-following models; long exposure to equities; carry momentum; use moderate leverage.

Upward Trend, Decreasing Volume, High Volatility

Regime: Euphoria or chasing rallies with shaky conviction.

Strategy: Scale back positions; use tighter risk controls; incorporate mean-reversion strategies or hedges.

Downward Trend, Increasing Volume, Low Volatility (Bear Market)

Regime: Steady downturn, but orderly.

Strategy: Defensive positioning; consider short exposures, long-duration bonds, safe-haven assets; low-leverage.

Downward Trend, Decreasing Volume, High Volatility

Regime: Fear and panic-driven sell-offs.

Strategy: Volatility-focused hedges (options, tail-risk protection); reduce directional risk; deploy mean-revert plays cautiously.

Consolidation Phase (Low Volatility)

Regime: Quiet, tight-range markets.

Strategy: Range-bound trades; small, systematic arbitrage; use low-risk short-term strategies.

Ranging Market (Sideways Trend with Low Volatility)

Regime: Flat but stable markets.

Strategy: Mean reversion; mean-reverting algorithms; oscillators; avoid trend ploys.

Upward Breakout (from Consolidation or Ranging)

Regime: A decisive bullish shift.

Strategy: Momentum breakouts; trend-entry algorithms; capture the new direction early; controlled leverage.

Downward Breakdown (from Consolidation or Ranging)

Regime: A sudden bear move erupting from crunched ranges.

Strategy: Short momentum patterns; protective hedges; quick risk-managed exits.

Why This Matters & How It Reflects Simons’ Approach

Regime-Dependent Models: Simons and Renaissance famously designed strategies that adapt to changing market structures, 
recognizing that one model doesn't fit all environments.

Systematic Detection: Identifying the market regime is central in deciding which quant model to activate—whether trend-following, mean-reversion, 
or volatility-based.

Backtesting Across Regimes: As noted in background reports, Simons insisted on exhaustive backtesting across different market conditions before deploying capital

Short Holding Periods & Leverage: Most trades were short-term—often under two weeks—and employed significant leverage when the model’s
 regime detection and signal were strong .

Quick Summary Table
Market State	Regime Description	Typical Strategy
1. Up ↑, Vol ↑, Low Vol	Bull-style rally	Trend-following, momentum
2. Up ↑, Vol ↓, High Vol	Volatile rally	Hedge, cautious, reduce exposure
3. Down ↓, Vol ↑, Low Vol	Bread-and-butter bear	Defensive, safe assets
4. Down ↓, Vol ↓, High Vol	Panic sell-off	Volatility hedging, mean-reversion
5. Consolidation, Low Vol	Market pause	Range-bound arbitrage
6. Ranging, Low Vol	Flat but stable	Mean reversion
7. Upward Breakout	New bull phase emergence	Momentum entry, breakout capture
8. Downward Breakdown	New bear phase emergence	Quick short strategies, hedged plays

It’s important to note that Simons’ real strategies were proprietary, deployed within highly complex and secretive quant systems.
But this eight-regime framework gives a helpful conceptual lens: tailoring algorithmic strategies to prevailing market behavior.
