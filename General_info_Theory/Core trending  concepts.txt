üìä Core Trading Concepts

Trend

General direction of the market (uptrend, downtrend, sideways).

‚ÄúThe trend is your friend.‚Äù

Volatility

How much the price fluctuates.

High volatility = big swings, risk + opportunity.

Low volatility = calmer, more stable moves.

Risk Management

Controlling losses so you don‚Äôt blow up your account.

Includes stop-loss, position sizing, risk/reward ratio.

Leverage

Borrowing money from your broker to trade bigger.

Amplifies both profits and losses.

Spread

Difference between bid price (buyers) and ask price (sellers).

Narrow spread = liquid market. Wide spread = illiquid.

Slippage

When your order executes at a worse price than expected, often in fast-moving or illiquid markets.

Order Types

Market order ‚Üí executes immediately at best available price.

Limit order ‚Üí executes only at your chosen price (or better).

Stop order ‚Üí triggers once price crosses a certain level (used for stop-losses).

Breakout / Breakdown

Breakout = price moves above resistance.

Breakdown = price falls below support.

Pullback / Retracement

A temporary move against the trend, before the trend continues.

Example: in an uptrend, small dips = pullbacks.

Reversal

When a trend actually changes direction (uptrend ‚Üí downtrend, or vice versa).

Liquidity Pools

Areas on the chart where lots of stop-losses and orders accumulate (usually near support & resistance).

Risk/Reward Ratio (R:R)

How much you risk vs how much you aim to gain.

Example: risk $100 for potential $300 ‚Üí R:R = 1:3 (good).

‚úÖ Summary in one line:
Trading revolves around price movement (trend, volatility, structure), market conditions (volume, liquidity, spread), and risk control (stop-loss, leverage, risk/reward).
